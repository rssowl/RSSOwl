TutorialPage_FINISH=Finish (13/13)
TutorialPage_FINISH_TEXT=You have \#completed\# the tutorial and \#learned\# about some of the \#concepts\# in RSSOwl. We hope you will \#enjoy\# using RSSOwl for a long time. If you have further \#questions\# or \#feedback\#, use one of the following links:
TutorialPage_FINISH_TITLE=We hope you will enjoy using RSSOwl.
TutorialPage_FORUMS=Discussion Forums
TutorialPage_IMPORT_EXPORT=Import and Export (9/13)
TutorialPage_IMPORT_EXPORT_TEXT=You can easily \#add more feeds\# to RSSOwl by using the Import Wizard (%File | Import%). Either choose to import feeds from a \#file\# or \#web site\# or let RSSOwl \#search for feeds\# that match any \#topic\# you are interested in (%Tools | Find more Feeds%).\n\nUse the Export Wizard (%File | Export%) to \#export\# your list of subscriptions including saved searches and news bins to a file.\n\n\#Tip:\# In addition to your subscriptions, you can export labels, news filters and settings to easily setup RSSOwl on a different computer.
TutorialPage_IMPORT_EXPORT_TITLE=Import and Export Feeds, Labels, News Filters and Settings.
TutorialPage_INTRO=Introduction (1/13)
TutorialPage_LAYOUT_TEXT=The user interface of RSSOwl is divided into two areas: The \#Feeds View\# on the left hand side is showing a list of your subscriptions. The main area on the right is filled with \#Tabs\# as soon as you open feeds to read them. A Tab shows the headlines of the feed and provides an \#embedded browser\# to read the content of a selected news.\n\nThe user interface can be \#configured\# in many ways: Take a look into the %View% menu and %Tools | Preferences | View% for related settings.\n\n\#Tip:\# You can customize the toolbar to include those actions you commonly use (%View | Customize Toolbar%).
TutorialPage_NEWS=News (3/13)
TutorialPage_NEWS_BIN_TEXT=A News Bin (%File | New | News Bin%) is a container for any number of news that have been \#moved\# (%News | Move To%) or \#copied\# (%News | Copy To%) into. Moving a news will delete it from its original source while copying will duplicate it. Use news bins like the \#archive\# if you think a news is \#worth keeping\# (%News | Archive News%). News Bins are very similar to feeds with the only difference that you decide about the news entries inside.\n\n\#Tip:\# You can create a News Filter (%Tools | News Filters%) to automatically move or copy news to news bins.
TutorialPage_NEWS_BINS=News Bins (5/13)
TutorialPage_NEWS_FILTER_POWER=The power of News Filters.
TutorialPage_NEWS_FILTER_TEXT=News Filters are likely the most \#powerful\# feature in RSSOwl. They allow to \#automate\# common actions like moving or copying a news into a news bin. You can create as many filters as you need (%Tools | News Filters%). Each filter is made up of \#search conditions\# to match specific news and a list of \#actions\# to perform on them. Once created, the filter will work on downloaded news that match the search conditions.\n\n\#Tip:\# A filter can be executed on existing news as well (%Tools | News Filters | Run Selected Filter%). Use this feature if you want to update lots of news at once.
TutorialPage_NEWS_FILTERS=News Filters (6/13)
TutorialPage_NEWS_TEXT=Once you have updated a Feed (%News | Update%), it will be populated with news entries. Each news entry can have one of four different \#states\#: At first, the news entry is \#new\#, indicating that it was just downloaded and not yet seen. Once you have read it, it will change to \#read\#. You can always mark it \#unread\# to come back to it at a later time. Finally, a news can show as \#updated\# if the author published new content to the entry.\n\nUse \#Labels\# (%News | Label%) to associate keywords with news entries. You can assign any number of labels and create new ones (%Tools | Preferences | Labels%). Mark a news entry as \#Sticky\# (%News | Mark | News as Sticky%) to highlight its importance. Sticky news show with a yellow color so that they can easily be distinguished from others.
TutorialPage_NOTIFICATIONS=Notifications (7/13)
TutorialPage_NOTIFIER_TEXT=The Notifier is a small \#popup\# that displays the headlines of incoming news even when RSSOwl is \#minimized\#. It can be configured in many ways to suit your needs (%Tools | Preferences | Notifier%). For instance, you might want to limit the Notifier to specific feeds or folders to make it show up less often. You can mark news entries as \#sticky\# from the Notifier to remember reading the full content of the entry at a later time.\n\n\#Tip:\# Use News Filters to show specific news inside the notifier. You can assign colors to distinguish specific news entries from others.
TutorialPage_NOTIFIER_TITLE=Be notified on incoming News.
TutorialPage_OVERVIEW=Overview (2/13)
TutorialPage_OVERVIEW_TITLE=Overview of RSSOwl's user interface.
TutorialPage_PREFERENCES=Preferences (11/13)
TutorialPage_PREFERENCES_TEXT=One of the \#strengths\# of RSSOwl is its ability to be customized and configured to \#suit your needs\#. Most settings can be defined on a fine grained level per \#folder\# and \#feed\# (%Edit | Properties%). For more settings, open the preferences dialog (%Tools | Preferences%) and take your time to browse through the various preference pages.\n\n\#Tip:\# The overview page gives a good explanation of the pages in the preferences dialog. You can also search across all preferences from the search field on top of the preferences dialog.
TutorialPage_SAVED_SEARCHES=Saved Searches (4/13)
TutorialPage_SAVED_SEARCHES_TEXT=RSSOwl is very powerful when it comes to \#searching across News\# (%Edit | Search News%). With the notion of \#Saved Searches\# (%File | New | Saved Search%), a search can be used like a feed you are subscribed to: The news entries of this \#special feed\# are made up of the \#search results\#.\n\nTake a look at the \#predefined saved searches\# in the feeds view to get an idea: %Todays News% contains all the news published today and %Sticky News% provides fast access to all news that are marked as sticky.\n\n\#Tip:\# You can limit the search results to a specific folder or feed when defining the search.
TutorialPage_SAVING_SEARCH_RESULTS=Saving search results.
TutorialPage_SHARE_FEEDS_TITLE=Share feeds and news with others.
TutorialPage_SHARING=Sharing (8/13)
TutorialPage_SHARING_TEXT=RSSOwl knows about a number of \#communities\# like \#Facebook\# and \#Twitter\# to share your feeds and news entries with. Simply open the menu on one of your subscriptions (%Share Feed%) or news entries (%Share News%) to bring up a list of communities for sharing. Once you have selected a community, the browser will open to complete the operation.\n\n\#Tip:\# The list of communities for sharing can be configured (%Tools | Preferences | Sharing%).
TutorialPage_STORING_NEWS_BINS=Storing News in Bins.
TutorialPage_SYNCHRONIZATION=Google Reader Synchronization (10/13)
TutorialPage_SYNCHRONIZATION_TEXT=RSSOwl allows you to \#synchronize subscriptions and articles\# with your Google Reader account. Use the import wizard to select the feeds you want to synchronize (%File | Import | Synchronize with Google Reader%).\n\nFor every feed imported from Google Reader, RSSOwl will automatically keep the \#read state, starred state and labels\# in sync. Use the clean-up settings to control the number of news to download per feed (%Properties | Clean Up | Maximum number of news to keep%).\n\n\#Note:\# At this time, there is no automated synchronization of the list of feeds you are subscribed to. Use the importer anytime to add more subscriptions from Google Reader.
TutorialPage_SYNCHRONIZATION_TITLE=Synchronize articles with your Google Reader account
TutorialPage_TIPS_AND_TRICKS=Tips and Tricks (12/13)
TutorialPage_TIPS_TEXT=Some \#useful tips and tricks\# that you might be interested in:\n- use the Newspaper View to read feeds (%View | Layout | Newspaper View%)\n- use Undo and Redo to revert or repeat actions on news (%Edit | Undo%, %Edit | Redo%) \n- frequently run the Clean Up Wizard to delete old news (%Tools | Clean Up%)\n- switch to Full Screen for not getting interrupted reading news (%View | Full Screen%)\n- quickly navigate between feeds and news (%Go | Next%, %Go | Previous%)\n- access common operations via keyboard shortcuts (%Tools | Preferences | Keys%)\n- create news filters to automatically download podcasts (%Tools | News Filters%)\n- protect your secure feeds with a Master Password (%Tools | Preferences | Passwords%)\n- search for Add-ons to add more functionality (%Tools | Add-ons%)
