UnsubscribeGoogleReaderAction_1=This action can not be undone
UnsubscribeGoogleReaderAction_2=This action will move all feeds that are synchronized with Google Reader to a folder called 'Google Reader Archive'. A copy of the feed will be created at the old location of the synchronized feed. This copy will not synchronize with Google Reader anymore and will not contain any of the news previously downloaded. It will keep the same preferences as the old feed though.\n\nYou are still able to read and search previously downloaded news in the 'Google Reader Archive' folder. We recommend to delete all feeds from the archive once you have moved important news to news bins. Press F1 to find out more about how to work with news bins to store news.
